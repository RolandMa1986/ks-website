This guide demonstrates how to management roles and members in your workspace. For the overview of KubeSphere roles, see the [Overview of Role Management](../todo). 

In workspace scope, you can grant the following resources' permissions to a role:

- Projects
- DevOps
- Access Control
- Apps Management
- Workspace Settings

## Prerequisites

At least one workspace has been created, such as `demo-workspace`. And you need an account of the `workspace-admin` role. See the [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/) if not yet.

{{< notice note >}} 

The actual role name follows a naming convention: `workspace name-role name`. For example, in this workspace named `demo-workspace`, the actual role name of the role `workspace-admin` is `demo-workspace-admin`.

## Create a Workspace Role

1. Log in the console as `ws-admin` and go to **Workspace Roles** in **Workspace Settings**.
2. In **Workspace Roles**, click **Create** and set a **Role Identifier**. In this example, a role named `workspace-projects-manager` will be created.

Click **Edit Authorization** to continue.

3. In **Projects management**, select the authorization that you want the user granted this role to have. For example, **Projects Create**, **Projects Management**, and **Projects View** are selected for this role. Click **OK** to finish.

**Depend on** means the major authorization (the one listed after **Depend on**) needs to be selected first so that the affiliated authorization can be assigned.

4. Newly-created roles will be listed in **Workspace Roles**. You can click the three dots on the right to edit it.

## Built-in roles

In **Workspace Roles**, there are four available built-in roles as shown below. Built-in roles are created automatically by KubeSphere when creating the workspace and they cannot be edited or deleted. You can only review permissions and authorized users.

| Built-in Roles     | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| workspace-viewer | Allows viewer access to view all resources in the workspace. |
| workspace-self-provisioner     | Regular user in the workspace who can create namespaces and DevOps projects.          |
| workspace-regular   | Regular user in the workspace who cannot create namespaces or DevOps projects. |
| workspace-admin     | Allows admin access to perform any action on any resource. It gives full control over all resources in the workspace. |

1. In **Workspace Roles** , click on the title of `workspace-admin`.
